   Note: Things that aren't done yet are marked as <span class="otlTodo">TODO</span>.</p></div>
  <h2 class="h2">Background</h2>
  <div class="t1p">
   <p class="t1p">I've used outliners for years to brainstorm and edit text. With
   the prospect of doing more writing, I've wanted to have an
   outliner that matched my editing style and wasn't too mouse-heavy.
   Since I'm a Vim user, and since Vim 6.0 added folding, it seemed
   natural to make an outliner out of it.  The name "TVO: The Vim
   Outliner" was suggested by Ben Peterson.</p></div>
  <h2 class="h2">Vim and folding</h2>
  <div class="t1p">
   <p class="t1p">The Vim editor has had folding added to it for version 6.0.</p>
   <p class="t1p">TVO uses Vim's folding capabilities to provide an outlining
   capability similar to that of familiar outliners:</p></div>
  <ul class="t1pa">
   <li class="t1pa">folded headlines hide all sub-headlines</li>
   <li class="t1pa">text blocks fold separately so you can see the first line under
   its corresponding headline.</li></ul>
  <div class="t1p">
   <p class="t1p">One of the things that TVO provides is a way to selectively hide
   all but the first line in a group of lines.</p>
   <p class="t1p">Another is changing the folding behavior of Vim to do the expected
   outline nexting.</p>
   <p class="t1p">By itself, Vim doesn't work quite right as an outliner. So I added
   a foldexpr() routine to make folding work right. This defines text
   blocks as level 10, and headlines from level 1 to 9 depending on
   how many tabs (0 to 8) precede them.</p></div>
  <h2 class="h2">About macros</h2>
  <div class="t1p">
   <p class="t1p">TVO can supply a number of keystroke macros. By default, these are
   two-character sequences that start with a backslash (\) character.
   However, the first character can be changed using the
   'maplocalleader' setting (see below).</p>
   <p class="t1p">In this document, wherever a macro is mentioned, it is shown with
   a backslash. If you've changed the 'maplocalleader' setting, make
   the required adjustment in your head.</p>
   <p class="t1p">For instance, the sequence to show all text is shown as \a here.
   If you've changed the 'maplocalleader' setting to ',' (as I do),
   then you'd actually type ,a for this operation.</p></div>
  <h2 class="h2">Syntax highlighting</h2>
  <div class="t1p">
   <p class="t1p">TVO uses Vim's syntax highlighting to color headlines.  The colors
   are fixed, though you can edit the syntax/otl.vim file to change
   them.</p>
   <p class="t1p">You can toggle between having bold (colored) headers and non-bold
   headers using the &lt;LocalLeader&gt;h (by default, '\h') command.</p></div>
  <h2 class="h2">Hyperlink navigation using Vim tags</h2>
  <div class="t1p">
   <p class="t1p">TVO provides hyperlinking between files using a "tags" file.
   When you jump to a tag, the tag is looked up in a tags file, and
   that file tells Vim where to jump to.</p>
   <p class="t1p">If you install the Viki script
   (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=861) you will
   have live links to URLs as well as the ability to define links
   between TVO files just by using a WikiName (capitalized word with
   internal caps) and navigating using a &lt;C-]&gt; or
   &lt;LocalLeader&gt;&lt;C-CR&gt; keystroke combination. If the file named by
   the link does not exist, you will be prompted whether you want to
   create that file.</p></div>
  <h3 class="h3">Vim tag navigation</h3>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">TVO provides four kinds of tags:</p></div>
  <ul class="t2pa">
   <li class="t2pa">Regular vim tags (that use an index file)</li>
   <li class="t2pa">Tags recognized by Viki (if you have it installed)</li>
   <li class="t2pa">File tags that refer directly to another file</li>
   <li class="t2pa">Vim command tags that can execute a Vim command directly
   (the tags below that start with "[:he" are an example of
   these)</li></ul>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">Either double click inside the square brackets below, or put
   your cursor between the square brackets below and hit ctrl-]
   to learn more about Vim's tag navigation features.</p>
   <p class="t2p"><span class="otlVimTagRef">[:he tags]</span></p>
   <p class="t2p">If you jump to a regular tag (as opposed to a file or to a Vim
   command reference) you can jump back using ctrl-T <span class="otlVimTagRef">[:he
   ctrl-T]</span>. If you jumped to a file, you can jump back using :e #
   or ctrl-^ <span class="otlVimTagRef">[:he ctrl-^]</span>.</p>
   <p class="t2p"><span class="otlTodo">TODO</span> ctrl-T will later jump back from other files as well.</p></div>
  <h3 class="h3">Jumping to tags</h3>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">You can jump from one outline to a specified point in the same
   or another outline by using the ctrl-] key, or by the "Jump to
   this tag" menu choice in the Tools menu, or by typing the "g"
   key and then clicking with the left mouse button.</p>
   <p class="t2p">You can jump back from the tag using the ctrl-T key, or by
   using Control-&lt;RightMouse&gt;, or by using g&lt;RightMouse&gt;</p>
   <p class="t2p">You can insert tag references in your text by using square
   brackets, like this:</p>
   <p class="t2p"><a class="otlTagRef" href="#this%20is%20a%20tag">this is a tag</a></p>
   <p class="t2p">Note that you can have spaces in the tag reference.</p></div>
  <h3 class="h3">Jumping to files</h3>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">If you enclose the name of a file within square brackets, and
   there is no tag by that name, then TVO will jump to the
   first line of that file instead.</p></div>
  <h3 class="h3">Jumping to arbitrary Vim commands</h3>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">You can make a tag that will execute a Vim command by
   prefixing it with a ':' sign:</p>
   <p class="t2p"><span class="otlVimTagRef">[:set]</span></p></div>
  <h3 class="h3">Jumping to anchors within another file (using Viki)</h3>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">If you have Viki installed, you can use its ability to define
   anchors
   Your link will look like</p>
   <p class="t2p">VikiName
   VikiName#anchor
   <a class="otlTagRef" href="#file%20name">file name</a>
   [<a class="otlExternTagRef" href="README.otl#anchor">README.otl#anchor</a><a class="otlTagRef" href="#name">name</a>]</p></div>
  <h3 class="h3">Specifying a different tags file</h3>
  <div class="t2p">
   <p class="t2p">The default tags file is "tags" in the current directory. If
   you want outlines in different directories to share tags
   files, you can change the Vim tags option in one of several
   ways:</p></div>
  <ul class="t2pa">
   <li class="t2pa">Use a modeline to set the tags option <span class="otlVimTagRef">[:he tags-option]</span>:
   | vim: tags=../tags</li>
   <li class="t2pa">Set up a .vimrc <span class="otlVimTagRef">[:he .vimrc]</span> (and set the exrc option
   <span class="otlVimTagRef">[:he 'exrc']</span>) </li>
   <li class="t2pa">Set it in your own .vimrc</li></ul>
